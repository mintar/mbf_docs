# Beginner Tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through a Turlebot Planning Tutorial with the default [Navigation Server](../../concepts/navigation_servers.md) in a Gazebo simulation environment and will make you familiar with the general planning workflow of using Move Base (Flex) in ROS. 

Before you continue, make sure to have followed the [Installation Instructions](../../installation.md) and you have a ROS workspace set up

```bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
```
