# Advanced Tutorials

After following the beginner tutorials, the following tutorials are meant to teach you how to implement comprehensive plans that include, among other things, recovery behaviors to enable you to use Move Base Flex in the real world.

## Topics
1. **State Machine (SMACH)** (Python) <br> Write you first state machine for the circle example you are familiar with. Continue [here](./smach.md).
2. **Continuous Replanning** <br> Learn to use Move Base Flex to your advantage and continously replan around dynamic obstacles. Continue [here](./continous_replanning.md).
3. **Recovery Behavior**: <br> Explore options to recover from fatal states during the plans execution. Continue [here](./recovery_behavior.md).
4. **Behavior Tree** (C++) <br> You will learn to implement a simple Behavior Tree, an alternative planning approach to State Machines. Continue [here](./behavior_tree.md).
5. **Behavior Tree** (Python) <br> Not ready to use C++? Follow this tutorials to learn to write a simple Behavior Tree in C++. Continue [here](./pytrees.md).
