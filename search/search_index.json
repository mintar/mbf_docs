In Short MBF, first are foremost, provides an enhanced version of the planner, controller and recovery plugin ROS interfaces . It exposes action servers for planning, controlling and recovering, providing detailed information of the current state and the plugin\u2019s feedback. An external executive logic can use MBF and its actions to perform smart and flexible navigation strategies. MBF enables the use of other map representations (besides cost maps), e.g. meshes or grid_map. Core Features Fully backwards-compatible with current ROS1 navigation. Actions for the submodules planning, controlling and recovering, and services to query the costmaps are provided. This interface allows external executives, e.g. SMACH, or Behavior Trees, to run highly flexible and complex navigation strategies. Comprehensive result and feedback information on all actions, including error codes and messages from the loaded plugins. For users still relying on a unique navigation interface, we have extended move_base action with detailed result and feedback information (though we still provide the current one). Separation between an abstract navigation framework and concrete implementations, allowing faster development of new applications, e.g. 3D navigation. Load multiple planners and controllers, selectable at runtime by setting one of the loaded plugin names in the action goal. Concurrency: Parallel planning, recovering, controlling by selecting different concurrency slots when defining the action goal. Only different plugins instances can run in parallel. Architecture Details We have created Move Base Flex for a larger target group besides the standard developers and users of move_base and 2D navigation based on costmaps, as well as addressed move_base's limitations. Since robot navigation can be separated into planning and controlling in many cases, even for outdoor scenarios without the benefits of flat terrain, we designed MBF based on abstract planner-, controller- and recovery behavior-execution classes for maximal flexibility . To accomplish this goal, we created abstract base classes for the nav core BaseLocalPlanner, BaseGlobalPlanner and RecoveryBehavior plugin interfaces, extending the API to provide a richer and more expressive interface without breaking the current move_base plugin API. The new abstract interfaces allow plugins to return valuable information in each execution cycle , e.g. why a valid plan or a velocity command could not be computed. This information is then passed to the external executive logic through MBF planning, navigation or recovering actions\u2019 feedback and result. The planner, controller and recovery behavior execution is implemented in the abstract execution classes without binding the software implementation to 2D costmaps (as in move_base). In our framework, move_base is just a particular implementation of a navigation system: its execution classes implement the abstract ones and bind the system to the costmaps. Thereby, the framework can easily be extended for customized navigation approaches , e.g. navigation on meshes or 3D occupancy grid maps. However, we provide a SimpleNavigationServer class without a binding to costmaps.

StateMachine ( outcomes = [ 'succeeded' , 'aborted' , 'preempted' ]) Next, we need to add states to the SMACH. In this simple case, all we need is a state to handle path planning, GET_PATH and another to handle the path execution, EXE_PATH . The states use smach_ros The smach_ros package contains extensions for the SMACH library to integrate it tightly with ROS. For example, SMACH-ROS can call ROS services, listen to ROS topics, and integrate with actionlib both as a client, and a provider of action servers. SMACH is a new library that takes advantage of very old concepts in order to quickly create robust robot behavior with maintainable and modular code. GET_PATH State smach . StateMachine . add ( 'GET_PATH' , smach_ros . SimpleActionState ( '/move_base_flex/get_path' , GetPathAction , goal_cb = get_path_callback , goal_slots = [ 'target_pose' ], result_slots = [ 'path' ] ), transitions = { 'succeeded' : 'EXE_PATH' , 'aborted' : 'aborted' , 'preempted' : 'preempted' }, remapping = { 'target_pose' : 'goal' } ) In our case, we need access to the goal, to tell out robot about the next waypoint: goal_slots=['target_pose'] the path, to tell the next state which path to execute: result_slots=['path'] While the goal_slots define the input values, result_slots indicate the output values. The seconds parameter tells the SMACH which action server to use to receive a path: /move_base_flex/get_path with the mbf_msgs/GetPathAction we already know from the beginner tutorials. The transitions parameters configures which states are visited next, depending on the result of the state. Note : If goals/results and userdata are named differently, you can change them with the remapping argument (not necessary in our case). e.g.: remapping = { 'target_pose' : 'goal' } Next use this callback to set the goal. After we set the goal, the state calls the /move_base_flex/get_path action server, and relays the result to the next state (Shown shortly). def get_path_callback ( userdata , goal ): try : goal . target_pose = next ( target_poses ) except StopIteration : rospy . logwarn ( \"Reached last target pose\" ) rospy . signal_shutdown ( \"Last goal reached.

On success, the path will transition to the GET_PATH state and will try to plan a new path from there. The exe_path_callback is used for verbosity only def exe_path_callback ( userdata , goal ): target_pose = goal . path . poses [ - 1 ] . pose rospy . loginfo ( \"Attempting to reach ( %1.3f , %1.3f )\" , target_pose . position . x , target_pose . position . y ) Userdata Finally, the result and goal slots we used to determine how the data will be passed between states, need to be set in the userdata : # Define userdata sm . userdata . goal = None sm . userdata . path = None Run the SMACH Launch gazebo export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL = burger roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch as well as Move Base Flex export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL = burger roslaunch mbf_advanced amcl_demo_mbf.launch Finally, start the SMACH rosrun mbf_advanced circle_smach.py","title":"Writing a simple SMACH"},{"location":"tutorials/advanced/smach/#writing-a-smach","text":"This Tutorial will walk you through writing a simple SMACH.

Note : If goals/results and userdata are named differently, you can change them with the remapping argument (not necessary in our case). e.g.: remapping = { 'target_pose' : 'goal' } Next use this callback to set the goal.

This does, however, make it harder to use advanced features of Move Base Flex. Let's start with understanding the differences between the respective Actions: mb_msgs/MoveBaseAction vs mbf_msgs/MoveBaseAction mb_msgs/MoveBaseAction In principle, every Move Base Action is defined as geometry_msgs/PoseStamped target_pose --- No Result Feedback (default) --- geometry_msgs/PoseStamped base_position Source mbf_msgs/MoveBaseAction Move Base Flex uses the same target/result feedback/action feedback structure, but adds new functionality: More detailed result feedback (per default) More defailed feedback possibilities plugins: controller (local planner), planner (global planner), recovery_behaviors geometry_msgs/PoseStamped target_pose # Controller to use; defaults to the first one specified on \"controllers\" parameter string controller # Planner to use; defaults to the first one specified on \"planners\" parameter string planner # Recovery behaviors to try on case of failure; defaults to the \"recovery_behaviors\" parameter value string[] recovery_behaviors --- # Predefined success codes: uint8 SUCCESS = 0 # Predefined general error codes: uint8 FAILURE = 10 uint8 CANCELED = 11 uint8 COLLISION = 12 uint8 OSCILLATION = 13 uint8 START_BLOCKED = 14 uint8 GOAL_BLOCKED = 15 uint8 TF_ERROR = 16 uint8 INTERNAL_ERROR = 17 # 21..49 are reserved for future general error codes # Planning/controlling failures: uint8 PLAN_FAILURE = 50 # 51..99 are reserved as planner specific errors uint8 CTRL_FAILURE = 100 # 101..149 are reserved as controller specific errors uint32 outcome string message # Configuration upon action completion float32 dist_to_goal float32 angle_to_goal geometry_msgs/PoseStamped final_pose --- # Outcome of most recent controller cycle.

If you have never heard of actionlib, the ROS Wiki has some good tutorials for it. We did, however, already use actionlib in earlier parts of this tutorial. In principle, a SimpleActionServer expects a name and an action (ROS message type) that it will perform. A SimpleActionClient can then connect to the Server by name and Action and send respective goals , which are just the specific action with a ROS header and Goal ID. Driving a Circle with Move Base Flex In the previous example, we used a relay to Move Base with a Move Base SimpleActionServer . Using this method, the Move Base Flex is hidden, so to speak, inside the relay, and the corresponding Move Base Client is limited to the functionality of the Move Base Action Server. The following example will use the additional information the Move Base Flex Action Server provides. We can use the Move Base Flex Action server that is started with Move Base Flex to interact with the framework directly. This is the circle driving robot with Move Base Flex only.
